# Current Status
Most of these files come from the PyScaffold and they are not edited, I have to learn how they work first.
The only file I am working on currently is SCHDprog/schprog/schprog.py.

The program can create a stiffened panel located at the bottom between two girders and two frames. The stiffeners are longitudinals and equally spaced. It calculates all the ISO rules for panels and the minimum section modulus and web area for stiffeners. It has a materials library, plating library and a profile library with extrusions. It produces an excel report containing scantlings and requirements, used profiles, topology metadata input ad structural weight.
